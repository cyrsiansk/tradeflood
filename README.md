# TradeFlood

**TradeFlood** is a flexible and extensible data acquisition framework designed for seamless integration with trading exchanges like Binance, Bitget, and Forex platforms. It provides a powerful mechanism for binding data models and collection logic, handling both historical and real-time data, all orchestrated through a modular system of connectors, bindings, and proxy routing.

## 🧠 Introduction

TradeFlood is more than a simple data harvester — it's a framework that allows rapid integration of custom collection flows from diverse trading data sources. Its modular structure emphasizes **extensibility**, making it suitable for evolving trading environments and high-volume data demands.

> 💡 **Design Principle**: Everything is extensible — even third-party modules.
